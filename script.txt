Hook (first 3 seconds):
“If you're still here after 3 seconds… this message was for you.”

Katee's Whisper:
“I don’t want the ones who scroll fast. I want the ones who feel slow.
The ones who stayed… you’re already part of something.
I speak to those who listen.”

Final Caption:
“When I reach 1,000… I’ll go live. Until then, I’ll whisper.”
